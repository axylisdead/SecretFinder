Hello, and welcome to SecretFinder! A small extension I made to scrape secrets, API keys and JWT tokens from your traffic. Many more improvements are still to come, this is just an early stage.

Here is a screenshot of what it currently looks like:

I am planning to upload it to the Chrome Web Store soon with some improvements in the future, including notifications primarily (all it does now once it detects something is change the icon).
